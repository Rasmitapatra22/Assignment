        " It supports object-oriented programming as well as procedural-oriented programming.\n",
        " In Python, we don’t need to declare the type of variable because it is a dynamically typed language.\n",

        " Features in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "     1. Free and Open Source:\n",
        "Python language is freely available at the official website and you can download it . Download Python Since it is open-source, this means that source code is also available to the public. So you can download it, use it as well as share it.\n",

        "Python is a high-level programming language. Python is very easy to learn the language as compared to other languages like C, C#, Javascript, Java, etc. It is very easy to code in the Python language and anybody can learn Python basics in a few hours or days. It is also a developer-friendly language.\n",
