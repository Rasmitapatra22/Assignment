The NumPy library offers a collection of high-level mathematical functions including support for multi-dimensional arrays, masked arrays and matrices. NumPy also includes various logical and mathematical capabilities for those arrays such as shape manipulation, sorting, selection, linear algebra, statistical operations, random number generation and discrete Fourier transforms.\n",
