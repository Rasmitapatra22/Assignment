        "\n",
        "Example: A table with columns like [Writer 1], [Writer 2], and [Writer 3] for the same book ID is not in 1NF because it repeats the same type of information (writers). Instead, all writers should be listed in separate rows.\n",

        "Example: If a column is meant for dates of birth (DOB), you cannot use it to store names. Each type of information should have its own column.\n",
        "3. Every Column Must Have a Unique Name\n",
        "Each column in the table must have a unique name. This avoids confusion when retrieving, updating, or adding data.\n",
