        "  **Instance Methods**\n",
        "Now let’s look at instance methods. Instance methods can access and modify both class attributes and instance attributes. Similar to a class method, an instance method is just a function in a class. It also starts with the keyword “def”. Its first parameter is the keyword “self”. The self parameter binds the method to the instance object. In the code below, we have added an instance method called insta_method. Notice that this insta_method has access to the attributes of the object (name and age) and the class attributes (home). Notice that we have changed the class attribute (home) value from “zoo” to “jungle”. When we call the instance method using the animal1 (animal1.insta_method) object, you can see that the output for location says “jungle” instead of “zoo”. Instance methods are used more often than class methods because they can access both class and instance attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Class Methods**\n",
        "Class methods are methods that are not bound to an instance of a class (object) but to the class itself. Remember, there are two types of attributes in a class; class attributes and instance attributes. Class attributes are bound to the class, while instance attributes are bound to an object. Class methods can only access and modify class attributes and not instance attributes. There are two ways to create a class method. The first method is to use the classmethod() function. The second method is to use the @classmethod decorator. In this article, we are going to use the decorator to create a class method. The first parameter of this class method is “cls”. The “cls” keyword simply means “referring to the class.”\n",
        "\n",
        "In our class below, there is a class attribute called “home.” We create a class method that can access and modify this class attribute. We create a function called “animals_home.” Right at the top of the function, we add the decorator @classmethod. This decorator converts the function into a class method. We use this method to change the class attribute. We change the home variable, from “Zoo” to “Jungle”. This proves that class methods can access and change class attributes.\n",

        "Method Resolution Order :\n",
        "Method Resolution Order(MRO) it denotes the way a programming language resolves a method or attribute. Python supports classes inheriting from other classes. The class being inherited is called the Parent or Superclass, while the class that inherits is called the Child or Subclass. In python, method resolution order defines the order in which the base classes are searched when executing a method. First, the method or attribute is searched within a class and then it follows the order we specified while inheriting. This order is also called Linearization of a class and set of rules are called MRO(Method Resolution Order). While inheriting from another class, the interpreter needs a way to resolve the methods that are being called via an instance. Thus we need the method resolution order."
